    "\n",
    "1)  The first is account information, including the number of accounts, delinquent history, mortgage info, and credit history. For instance - \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percent of trades never delinquent (pct_tl_nvr_dlq)**: Delinquency refers to payments that were late (Payment History). Higher delinquency can result in lower credit score which can influence the probability of returning the loan (loan status).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of mortgage accounts (mort_acc)**: More mortgage accounts may indicating higher investment money. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Months since oldest bank installment account opened (mo_sin_old_il_acct)**: Bank account duration can imply the borrowers’ investment or deposit strategy. People with longer account duration may have more saving than the rest, which means they have a higher chance to pay the money back. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average current balance (avg_cur_bal)**: average current balance can reflect the property (money) situation of the user. With more backup money, users can pay the bill with interest more easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Charge Offs in last Year (chargeoff_within_12_mths)**: A charge-off is a declaration by a creditor that an amount of debt is unlikely to be collected. Users that have a higher charge-off number may have a lower probability to return the loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The number of accounts on which the borrower is now delinquent (acc_now_delinq)**: may reflect the spending habit and credit status of the borrower.\n",

    "2)  The first is income information, including the annual income, categorized employment length. These variables could indicate borrower’s ability to fulfill the loan.\n"

    "Sensitivity is defined as the probability of identifying true fully-paid (or any form of delayed payments) from exact full paid. Specificity is defined as the probability of identifying true charge-offs (or any other forms of delays) from exact delays. We could see that all models except QDA tend to have high specificity but low sensitivity on real data, where the majority of the accepted loans are fully paid. Hence they tend to make conservative predictions that tend to be cautious about whether someone could payback. Perhaps due to the relatively conservative prediction strategy from our models, we confirmed that except QDA, each model could give over a 15% increase in return on investment. \n",

On the other hand, some states, like NY and NJ, have relative small successful return loan rate but have accepting rate.\n",

We can see that the dots are more centered towards the trend line, indicating that the accept rate depends more on the successfully paid rate. Also, the $R^2$ of these two linear models are higher than the original model, which suggests that using the acceptance rate predicted by our models, the linear regression model can explain more variability of the response data. Therefore, we can conclude that if adopting the investment strategy based on our random forest or neural network models, there would be less potential demographic discrimination.\n",
