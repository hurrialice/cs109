## Lets have fun

>here is a quote

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$





## Background  


Lending Club is the lending network to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It's mission is to transform the banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding [1]. The Lending Club platform connects borrowers to investors and facilitates the payment of loans up to \$40,000 [2]. The basic idea is that borrowers apply for a loan on the Lending Club Marketplace. Investors can review the loan applications, along with risk analysis provided by LendingClub, to determine how much of the loan request they are willing to fund. When the loan is funded, the borrower will receive the loan.



Based on the setting of this platform, investors can make wrong decisions in some situations (the borrower received the loan even they don't have ability to return the money). In this case, we want to provide a better model that can predict the probability of fully return.    



Moreover, similar to other loan and investment platforms, Lending Club claims it is an "Equal Housing Lender" which means "the bank makes loans without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status." [4] With this in mind, analyzing discrimination cross states is also necessary.
